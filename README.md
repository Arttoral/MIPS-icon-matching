# MIPS Icon matching 
• Translated a baseline C model comparing 8 144-pixel icons into MIPS assembly, reducing dynamic instructions to 250
while using only 10 registers, improving runtime efficiency.


• Optimized inner-loop logic to reduce instruction overhead by over 260%, resulting in significantly faster execution on the
MIPS architecture.
